# Paymaster And Batch Transactions

## Overview

This sub-directory presents a Proof of Concept (PoC) showcasing the implementation of **Paymaster** functionalities and **Batch transactions** on the zkSync network. Explore deployment scripts and detailed flows to understand the capabilities and interactions within the zkSync network for efficient and scalable transactions.

## Paymaster

![Paymaster Flows](./diagrams/paymaster-transaction-flow.png)

**Paymasters in zkSync** allow for fee compensation and ERC20 token fee payments, enhancing user experience and flexibility. Users interacting with a paymaster should provide the non-zero paymaster address in their EIP712 transaction.
